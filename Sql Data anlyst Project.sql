-- 3. Complex Fraud Detection Using Multiple CTEs
-- Question:
-- Use multiple CTEs to identify accounts with suspicious activity, including large transfers, consecutive transactions without balance change, and flagged transactions.

WITH large_transfers as (
SELECT nameOrig,step,amount FROM transactions WHERE type = 'TRANSFER' and amount >500000),
no_balance_change as (
SELECT nameOrig,step,oldbalanceOrg,newbalanceOrig FROM transactions where oldbalanceOrg=newbalanceOrig),
flagged_transactions as (
SELECT nameOrig,step FROM transactions where  isflaggedfraud = 1) 

SELECT 
    lt.nameOrig
FROM 
    large_transfers lt
JOIN 
    no_balance_change nbc ON lt.nameOrig = nbc.nameOrig AND lt.step = nbc.step
JOIN 
    flagged_transactions ft ON lt.nameOrig = ft.nameOrig AND lt.step = ft.step;


-- 4. Write me a query that checks if the computed new_updated_Balance is the same as the actual newbalanceDest in the table. If they are equal, it returns thoseÂ rows.

with CTE as (
SELECT amount,nameorig,oldbalancedest,newbalanceDest,(amount+oldbalancedest) as new_updated_Balance 
FROM transactions
)
SELECT * FROM CTE where new_updated_Balance = newbalanceDest;
